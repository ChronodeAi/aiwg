/**
 * Tier 0 writer worktree preparation and ownership (FR-OG-039, FR-OG-068,
 * #2889 / B-OG-13). Extends Rule 9 step 4 ("Prepare the worktree") with the
 * exact-base-digest binding and overlapping-claim refusal that step only
 * described narratively.
 *
 * The conductor — never the worker — owns worktree creation and the claim
 * registry below. A worktree is created at an exact recorded base digest
 * (`git rev-parse <revision>`, not a moving ref) so later acceptance can
 * bind to a specific tree; two writer claims on the same file or port
 * refuse to both proceed rather than silently interleave writes.
 *
 * This module adds no daemon, store, or scheduler: `WorktreeClaimRegistry`
 * is a plain in-memory ownership table the conductor process holds for the
 * duration of its own run, matching the Tier 0 "no admission store" scope.
 * Managed, cross-conductor disk reservations and leases remain Tier 1
 * (deferred to S2+; see `agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/subagent-scoping.md`
 * Rule 9 and `08-security-and-threat-model.md`'s Tier 1 brief/retention
 * section).

 * ordinary umask — which conventionally narrows group/other bits that
 * `0o700` does not request in the first place — leaves the result
 * unchanged). Every created component is still verified with `lstatSync`
 * immediately afterward and this throws (never silently `chmod`s) if the
 * resulting mode is not EXACTLY `0o700` — catching, rather than silently
 * tolerating, an unusual host umask that narrows even owner bits. Existing
