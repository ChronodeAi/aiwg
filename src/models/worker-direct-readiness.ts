/**
 * Direct-worker onboarding/readiness (issue #2894, S1 Tier 0 direct handoff).
 *
 * For each configured worker this reports two separate facts that must never
 * be merged:
 * - "installation readiness": is the CLI installed, and is the installed
 *   version in the registered range;
 * - "dispatch eligibility": what the resolver itself decides for this cli
 *   (worker_dispatch, per-cli enable, adapter binding, group/member
 *   qualification). When the caller supplies a `resolverSnapshot`, this calls
 *   the actual offline dispatch resolver (`resolveWorkerPlan` in resolver.ts)
 *   for every group member referencing the cli and reports its real
 *   member-specific refusals (missing installation/model evidence, policy
 *   denials, etc.) — never a re-derived approximation. Without a
 *   `resolverSnapshot` (for callers that have not resolved the wider model
 *   config/catalog), this falls back to a binding-only check through
 *   `resolveWorkerGroupInstallation` and says plainly that the result is
 *   binding-level only, not a dispatch verdict.
 *
 * Probing is opt-in. `diagnoseDirectWorkerReadiness` starts no process unless
 * the caller supplies a `probe`; surfaces such as `aiwg doctor` report
 * configuration from config and the registry by default and only probe behind
 * an explicit flag. Immediately before each probe, the resolved executable
 * and its version argv are announced through the caller's `announce`
 * callback (synchronous, never buffered) so operators see exactly what is
 * about to run before anything is spawned. The single probe implementation
 * lives in the shared installation owner (`boundedVersionProbe` in
 * worker-installation.mjs) with its credential-free environment allowlist and
 * bounds; this module only maps its outcome onto readiness findings.
 *
 * Trust boundary: a version probe runs the executable named by project
 * configuration (or the registry default) with only its registered
 * `versionArgv`, a filtered credential-free environment, and an explicit
 * cwd. That configuration is an execution trust boundary, not an executable
 * allowlist — project configuration can select an arbitrary binary, and a
 * `versionArgv` label cannot prove the selected program is side-effect free.
 * Opting into `--probe-workers` trusts that executable (and, for bare names,
 * PATH resolution) to the same extent any other locally invoked tool is
 * trusted.
 *
 * The configured `adapter` binding is always resolved through the same
 * public resolver used by installation and dispatch (`resolveWorkerGroupInstallation`
 * / `resolveWorkerAdapter`): exact, case-sensitive namespace:id references,
 * with implicit canonical `providers:<cli>` bindings for cli ids that are
 * only referenced by a group member and have no explicit `parallelism.clis`
 * entry. No alias normalization happens here — a binding this module accepts
 * is a binding the public config validator also accepts, and vice versa.
 *
 * The shipped direct profiles are declarations, not live qualification: no
 * finding ever calls a profile "qualified". Explicit operator approval uses `aiwg doctor --probe-workers --qualify`;
 * a probe alone does not qualify a profile, and an installed, in-range CLI
 * can still be refused by the resolver — the dispatch finding says so
 * plainly with the resolver's own reason.
 *
 * Decision 17 (baseline simplification) dropped provider qualification
 * runners, attestations and prescribed evidence files; this module therefore
 * performs no live-qualification recording and requires no evidence files.
