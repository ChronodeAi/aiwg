# ADR: Rule activation and bound-rule delivery

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-10-18
Decision owners: AIWG maintainers
Related: #2935, #2936–#2945, #3222, #2562, #2839, #2645, #2646, #3292, #3568

## Context

Severity currently determines delivery through `isAlwaysOnRule` in
[`base.mjs`](../../tools/agents/providers/base.mjs). CRITICAL/HIGH and unclassified
rules pass; MEDIUM/LOW do not. `applies_to`, `scope`, and manifest `rules` arrays
do not deliver bindings. `showArtifact` in
[`query-engine.ts`](../../src/artifacts/query-engine.ts) returns artifact text
without its rules. The Cursor adapter's comments describe activation support,
but its current transform mostly forces `alwaysApply: true`; the implemented
exceptions recognize `globs`/`applyTo`, not the proposed five-mode schema.

The epic's October 17 baseline reports 207,444 B of rules and indexes plus
33,411 B of behavior context on `aiwg use sdlc --provider claude`: 240,855 B,
approximately 60K tokens, repeated in sessions and subagents. Its original
155,740 B measurement describes an older project-local deployment, not this
fresh SDLC profile. The corpus snapshot in that update is 159 rules; counts
and byte totals are measurements, not schema constants.

An offline replay of the framework, addon, and extension rule deployment
passes at this worktree's `c59e7a9e1` reproduces **207,444 B** and all six
budget demotions. Its directory contains **39 bodies plus two indexes**, not
the update's reported 40 bodies. The appendix enumerates the actual files
rather than inventing a fortieth. The eight generated behavior files total
32,927 B in this replay (240,371 B combined); their wrappers contain deployment
paths, so retain the PO's 33,411 B as its original baseline, not a byte-exact
fixture for another target path. Phase 0 (#2936) must pin source, target-path
normalization, and counting method for reproducible comparisons.
These directory-byte measurements include native path-scoped files; actual
harness startup loading can defer those bodies. Keep the directory footprint
and observed context consumption separate in Phase 0 reports.

The 64,000-token default in #2562 uses estimated UTF-8 bytes / 4, not a 64 KB
limit. Largest-first reconciliation across deployment passes drops
`anti-laziness`, `auto-compact-continue`, `cli-secondary`,
`debug-source-not-output`, `delivery-policy`, and `subagent-scoping` into
discovery with no binding. This is a delivery defect even though an on-demand
index still calls them binding rules.

## Decision

### Activation selects delivery; severity selects consequence

Each authored rule and behavior declares exactly one activation mode. Severity
(`enforcement`) remains independent: a scoped CRITICAL rule can be bound, and a
HIGH universal rule can be kernel. Installation/trust selection still applies;
activation does not install an excluded addon or authorize an operation.

| Mode | Delivery obligation | Incremental global startup cost |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | Deliver the compact `<name>.core.md` body (at most 1024 bytes; all core bodies together at most 6144 bytes) to every provider's always-loaded surface in every deploy mode, placed before kernel rules and never demoted or spilled. The full rule stays reachable only by plain path or `aiwg show rule <name>`, never an `@` import. Owned by the always-installed `aiwg-utils` addon. | The compact body only, within the reserved 6144-byte core budget (also counted in the inline budget). |
| `kernel` | Load the complete canonical rule body in every session and subagent before task execution. | Full body plus framing. |
| `summary` | Load one imperative summary and a full-rule pointer in the kernel index; deliver it through bindings as well when declared. | Summary (at most 240 characters), identity, and pointer, never the full body. |
| `bound` | Deliver when a declared skill, agent, or flow is loaded/invoked. | Zero rule text; bound blocks live inside artifact bodies, not their startup listings. |
| `paths` | Deliver the full rule when any declared project-relative path glob matches a file being read or changed; bindings can also deliver it. | Native loaders: no unmatched body, possibly native description/glob metadata. Emulated loaders: a compact glob/summary/pointer index, never unmatched bodies. |
| `on-demand` | Discoverable and explicitly fetchable; no automatic delivery. | Zero rule text; use the shared discovery entry point rather than a startup list of every rule. |

Core delivery by provider (#3450): Claude writes `.claude/rules/core-<name>.md`;
Cursor writes `.cursor/rules/core-<name>.mdc` with `alwaysApply: true`; Codex,
Hermes, Warp and the other emulated providers put a `## Core rules` section
first in their managed startup block (`AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.omp/AGENTS.md`, `WARP.md`), inline
for Hermes even when the rule is not `critical`. A deploy fails with a clear
diagnostic when a body exceeds 1024 bytes, the core set exceeds 6144 bytes, a
body is missing, or a body contains an `@` file reference. `aiwg doctor` reports
the core slice (`bytes used / 6144`) separately from the aggregate startup
context. Operator pins do not re-promote a core rule.

Provider skill/agent listings have their own cost; `bound` does not promise to
eliminate that existing cost. Invocation-time retrieval counts as task context.
Bootstrap retrieval of kernel bodies counts as startup context even if it uses
a file read rather than an inline import. Measurements must not hide either.

`bound_to` is an additional delivery route, not a sixth mode. The epic's
“bound + paths” means **`activation: paths` plus `bound_to`**, with OR semantics.
Either a matching file or a bound artifact activates delivery. Identity-based
deduplication prevents duplicate rule text within one artifact/show response.

### Frontmatter contract for #2938

This is the source shape; this ADR adds no parser, schema, or runtime behavior.
Existing rule identity, severity, description, and discovery triggers remain.

```yaml
---
name: debug-source-not-output
enforcement: high
activation: paths
summary: "Locate and fix canonical source before changing generated output; regenerate and verify the result."
bound_to:
  skills: []
  agents: [debugger, self-debug]
  flows: []
paths: ["tools/**", "src/**", "agentic/**", "dist/**"]
---
```

The example uses existing debugging agents. #2938 validates concrete targets
against the artifact index before accepting a migrated declaration.

| Field | Shape and validation |
|---|---|
| `activation` | Scalar enum: `core`, `kernel`, `summary`, `bound`, `paths`, `on-demand`. Required after migration. A sequence, combined string, or unknown mode is an error. |
| `summary` | Nonempty single-line imperative string, at most 240 Unicode code points after trimming. Required for `summary`, `bound`, and `paths`; optional for `kernel`/`on-demand`. Never synthesize it by truncating the body. |
| `bound_to` | Mapping with only `skills`, `agents`, `flows`; each value is a list of nonempty canonical artifact IDs. Missing lists mean empty. At least one target is required for `bound`; optional for `summary`/`paths`. Reject bindings on `core`/`kernel`/`on-demand` as contradictory or redundant. |
| `paths` | Nonempty list of project-relative glob strings, required for `paths` and rejected on other tagged modes. Match normalized `/` paths; reject absolute paths and parent traversal. Match reads and writes, including proposed new filenames. |

Bindings resolve by artifact type and canonical ID, using existing index
precedence and ambiguity errors. They are exact identifiers, not title guesses,
filesystem paths, or unresolved wildcard families. Tables below use `flow-*`,
`issue-*`, and role families as migration shorthand: each wave expands them to
concrete installed/indexed targets and lints them. A declared missing or
ambiguous target fails lint; there is no silently empty binding. A valid target
outside the selected deployment need not be copied just because a rule names it.

Flows retain their indexed identity even when a provider projects them as a
skill or command. The deployed representation receives the same block. An
artifact naming rules in its manifest does not create the reverse binding.
Migrate `applies_to`/`scope` intent to explicit `bound_to`; they remain descriptive
legacy metadata, not competing activation inputs. Manifest `rules` arrays remain
inventory only.

**`enforcedBy`** was reserved during the activation rollout. #2839 defines it as
an optional list of `<namespaced-pack-id>#<gate-id>` strings, checked by the
existing rule schema and resolved by lint against the composed gate registry.
`aiwg gates coverage` reports these declarations and labels unmapped rules
guidance-only. A declaration does not dispatch hooks or execute gates.
Activation delivers instructions; it is not proof that a runtime enforces them.

### Both binding delivery paths are required

**A — Deploy time:** the existing base deployer resolves reverse bindings and
adds a generated `Bound rules` block to each deployed skill, agent, and flow
body, after provider projection as needed. Kernel-listed artifacts need this
because native invocation can bypass `aiwg show`. Use managed delimiters,
replace rather than accumulate the block on redeploy, sort by canonical rule
ID, and preserve authored content. Do not add the block to artifact descriptions
or aggregate every bound body into provider startup files.

```markdown
<!-- AIWG:bound-rules:start -->
## Bound rules

- debug-source-not-output — Locate and fix canonical source before changing generated output; regenerate and verify the result.
  Fetch and follow before governed work: `aiwg show rule debug-source-not-output`.
<!-- AIWG:bound-rules:end -->
```

**B — Show time:** `showArtifact` resolves the same bindings for source artifacts
and appends the same summary/pointer block in text output. It covers discovered
artifacts whose source has no generated block. The JSON envelope adds
`bound_rules[]` for bound artifacts; keep `content` as authored source text.
Unbound artifact output remains unchanged, including no new empty JSON member.
The proposed opt-in `--with-rule-bodies` adds complete bodies (and text sections)
for callers that must forward a self-contained task to another agent.

```json
{
  "bound_rules": [{
    "name": "debug-source-not-output",
    "activation": "paths",
    "summary": "Locate and fix canonical source before changing generated output; regenerate and verify the result.",
    "show_command": "aiwg show rule debug-source-not-output"
  }]
}
```

With the flag, each item additionally has `content`, the complete rule body.
Summaries are priming, not substitutes for fetching detailed requirements:
invocation instructs the consumer to fetch the body before its governed work.
Default full-body injection would multiply context across many artifacts and
subagents. Explicit body expansion supports deterministic handoff at the cost
of larger task context. Never truncate an expanded body to fit a budget.

[`src/mcp/tools/discovery.mjs`](../../src/mcp/tools/discovery.mjs) already wraps
CLI JSON show. Extend its existing skill/agent/command (including projected
flow) tools with equivalent body-expansion input and return the identical
`bound_rules` shape; do not build another binding registry. `aiwg show rule X`
also lists its resolved bound targets. Source and deployed representations must
not cause double expansion; resolve one direct reverse lookup, not recursive
rule-to-rule inclusion. Missing declared rule content produces a diagnostic
and failure, not a successful artifact response with an incomplete contract.

Behavior contracts use the same resolver and block. Index their rule-facing
projection as `behavior/<name>` so, for example,
`aiwg show rule behavior/concierge` cannot collide with the `concierge` agent.
This reuses the existing artifact index/query path, not a separate subsystem.
Native behavior hook/script execution remains owned by its current runtime.

### Provider projection

**Operator decision 2026-10-29 (#3740):** startup owners contain only the
WORKSPACE.md → AIWG.md bootstrap, precedence statement, unchanged compact core
bodies, and one hook line per deployed harness. Kernel bodies, summary indexes,
path indexes and definition routes live in each harness's rules location.
Provider-specific managed sections preserve other deployed harnesses' hooks and
operator text outside AIWG blocks. Redeployment removes former inline blocks.

| Provider | `kernel` / `summary` delivery | `paths` delivery |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | Complete bodies and summary `RULES-INDEX.md` in `.claude/rules/`, loaded natively; compact core remains native. | Native `paths` frontmatter. |
| Cursor | Complete MDC bodies and index in `.cursor/rules/`, `alwaysApply: true`; compact core remains native. | Native MDC `globs`, `alwaysApply: false`. |
| Grok Build | Complete Markdown bodies and index in `.grok/rules/`, discovered by the verified native loader. AGENTS.md names the index. | Index and explicit fetch; no verified glob attachment. |
| Windsurf | Complete bodies and index in `.windsurf/rules/`, `trigger: always_on`. AGENTS.md names the index. | `trigger: glob` with the translator's `glob` field. |
| OpenCode | Complete bodies and index in `.opencode/rule/`, registered through `opencode.json` `instructions` (recursive Markdown glob). Preserve existing config and instruction entries. | Index and explicit fetch; instructions registration is unconditional. |
| Codex | `.codex/rules/RULES-INDEX.md` lists every complete local kernel file; AGENTS.md requires reading it before every task and subagent task. | Prompt index/check, fetch matching rules. |
| Muse | `.muse/rules/RULES-INDEX.md`, reached through its own AGENTS.md hook. No declared rules path exists; `.muse` follows its existing harness directory convention. | Prompt index/check. Workspace trust still applies. |
| Factory / Antigravity / Pi | `.factory/rules/`, `.antigravity/rules/`, `.pi/rules/` respectively; RULES-INDEX and complete local kernel files reached through each harness's AGENTS.md hook. | Prompt index/check. |
| Hermes | `.hermes/rules/RULES-INDEX.md` and every complete kernel file, reached through hooks in both `.hermes.md` and AGENTS.md. | Prompt index/check. |
| Copilot | `.github/instructions/RULES-INDEX.md` and complete local kernel files reached through `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; this adapter does not claim an automatic rule loader. | Prompt index/check. |
| Warp / OMP | `.warp/rules/` through WARP.md; `.omp/rules/` through `.omp/AGENTS.md`. Each hook requires reading RULES-INDEX and every local kernel file. | Prompt index/check. |
| OpenClaw | Complete bodies and index in its existing rules location, reached through the active workspace AGENTS.md hook. | Prompt index/check. |

On prose-only harnesses, kernel rules are reached because the hook directs the
agent to read them, not through an automatic loader. RULES-INDEX names every
kernel file and requires reading all of them before every task and subagent
task. It also carries summary instructions, full-rule fetch commands and path
checks. Bound rules still use artifact-body blocks and show/MCP; on-demand
bodies stay outside native recursively loaded rule trees. No startup hook
inlines kernel, summary or path indexes. All rule-file bytes reached through
hooks remain included in deployment accounting and managed-file receipts.

Cursor's `auto(description)` is a model-selected retrieval hint, not an exact
binding or a guaranteed policy gate. It supplements summary-mode delivery; it
cannot replace A or B. `on-demand` and `bound` must not accidentally become
auto rules merely because source discovery metadata has a description. Both
the adapter transform and external Cursor deploy script must honor the mapping;
remove the old blanket always-apply fallback for tagged rules.

For emulated `paths`, add a fixed instruction to the kernel index: before
reading/changing files, compare intended paths with the compact path-rule index,
then fetch matching bodies. The index contains ID, globs, summary, and pointer.
An agent-only task has no path match. If the task starts without known paths,
check when paths become known, before their first read/write. This is prompt
emulation, not an OS hook or mechanically guaranteed interception; fixtures
and positive/negative probes must expose that limitation. Do not inline all
path-rule bodies as a fallback.

The 8 KiB per-file bridge guard is unchanged; this repository's fixture config
must produce AGENTS.md ≤4 KB. Compact core budgets remain ≤1,024 B per body and
≤6,144 B total, always loaded and never demoted or spilled. Core full bodies
remain fetchable without automatic imports.

The **Operator decision 2026-10-29** supersedes Hermes's **2026-10-19**
CRITICAL-only inline exception. All kernel bodies now live in rule files,
including CRITICAL rules and explicit pins. There is no 19,000-byte overflow
projection or inline kernel index. Keep Hermes's final context hard cap of
19,000 characters for bootstrap, core, wrappers and operator additions; rule
file bodies do not consume that file's cap. Preserve its explicit fetch-and-follow
obligation in the hook. Bulk `use all` retains its kernel-skill-only selection.

### Budget is a guard, never an activation selector

Resolve activation, bindings, and provider projection first; then calculate
startup cost across the final assembled deployment, including indexes,
behaviors, generated wrappers, and emulated path metadata. Intermediate addon
passes must not demote files or hide a final overrun.

#2938 introduces `rules.inline_budget_tokens` in `aiwg.config`; the existing
`AIWG_RULES_INLINE_BUDGET_TOKENS` override wins. Default remains 64,000, and zero
disables this configurable guard only, not provider hard caps. Invalid values
are diagnostics. Retain the documented bytes / 4 estimate with raw bytes in
reports so this is not mistaken for exact vendor token accounting.

The existing lint runner reports limit, selected total, provider, and per-file
contributors. CI/strict deployment fails on an overrun; migration/report-only
lint may warn. A warning preserves the entire activation-selected set. A
failure leaves the prior managed deployment intact by validating the planned
result before promotion. Neither outcome changes a rule's activation. Remove
the budget sidecar's authority to suppress files; reconcile old managed files
and retire stale `.aiwg-rules-budget.json` state during #2939 deployment.

Resolve the six existing demotions explicitly, with binding before removal:

| Previously demoted rule | Intended delivery |
|---|---|
| `anti-laziness` | `summary`, bound to code-producing/review/testing agents and iterative coding workflows; its detailed policy is scoped to implementation, not every conversational turn. |
| `auto-compact-continue` | `summary`, bound to Ralph, missions, and long-running flows. |
| `cli-secondary` | `summary`, bound to steward, finder, and maintenance artifacts. |
| `debug-source-not-output` | `paths` plus debugger/self-debug bindings. |
| `delivery-policy` | `summary`, bound to delivery/release/tracker artifacts. |
| `subagent-scoping` | `summary`, bound to orchestration artifacts. |

Until each move passes its behavioral gate, restore that rule's intended
pre-budget fallback delivery. If the restored set exceeds the guard, report or
fail explicitly; do not reintroduce discovery-only limbo. Raising a guard may
unblock a reviewed migration deployment but cannot override a provider cap.

### Untagged migration fallback

Missing `activation` produces a lint warning naming the file and inferred
delivery. Preserve the old **tier selection**, not its silent budget loss:
CRITICAL/HIGH, BLOCK, unknown, and absent enforcement remain kernel candidates;
MEDIUM/LOW remain on-demand. Generated indexes are structural exceptions, not
authored rules admitted by severity. Preserve existing provider behavior for
untagged rules, including legacy path transforms and Hermes directives, while
warning about gaps. Tagged `paths` rules bypass the tier filter, fixing
MEDIUM `sdlc-orchestration` and `voice-framework` when migrated.

An invalid explicit activation is an error, never “untagged.” Existing behavior
wrappers remain loaded until explicitly migrated; absent severity is not a
reason to drop them. #2945 and #3222 promote missing-activation warnings to
errors for the complete authored corpus. No permanent tier fallback remains
after coverage reaches 100%.

### Testable kernel admission

A proposed kernel rule must pass **all** of these review/fixture checks:

1. **Universal guard:** name the invariant every agent must preserve before
   knowing its task, tool, path, workflow, or daemon role. A rule whose only
   trigger is release, debugging, orchestration, a bot message, or a particular
   file tree fails. A universal prohibition can be dormant on a given turn;
   it must still constrain every role whenever that action arises.
2. **Retrieval cannot precede the need:** supply a counterexample where a
   compliant agent could violate the invariant before selecting any scoped
   artifact/path. If a binding/path can always deliver it first, choose that
   route instead. “HIGH” or “important” alone does not pass.
3. **Compact, self-contained authority:** put only the imperative core in the
   kernel rule, with no required dereference to learn that core. Move long
   examples/rationale into on-demand companions, without truncating the rule
   at deployment. Reject duplicate normative text already supplied by another
   kernel rule or startup template; verify generated startup output for repeats.
4. **Provider fit:** deployment fixtures verify complete selected kernel files
   and native activation or the explicit task/subagent hook. No kernel body may
   be inline in AGENTS.md. Missing hooks or kernel files fail the fixture.
   Preserve configured budgets and provider caps, counting hook-reached files.
5. **Observed compliance:** provide positive probes for the universal invariant
   and ordinary tasks outside its originating workflow, n=5 each. Meet or
   exceed baseline with no probe below 80%. Failed admission retains the prior
   placement and blocks the move; word count or severity cannot waive it.

#### Compound discovery admission addendum (#3292)

Discovery now delivers the selected action's governing bound rules, matching
project paths and declared triggers, with `required_rule_checks` and explicit
fetch-and-follow-before-work obligations. These are delivery contracts, not
claims of mechanical enforcement. The routing kernel requires agents to
complete every such check before invoking a discovered or already loaded
skill, agent, command, or flow, including subagent work. Kernel rules are not
repeated in compound discovery results.

This strengthens admission check 2: when discovery or the selected component's
binding can reliably deliver a task-specific rule first, that route is the
candidate placement. It does not prove the move safe. The universal safety
core and routing rule remain admitted under all five checks above; severity
and a byte target cannot demote a rule. This change moves or removes no safety
rule. U5 positive/negative model evidence at n=5 and the real release comparison
remain required before approving any new migration; offline fetch-order probes
only verify the delivery/assertion mechanism.

Response `rule_stats` counts unique attached rules and every emitted required
check, including medium/low rules. Whole-response totals deduplicate rules
shared by several ranked artifacts, merging their applicability reasons.
This differs intentionally from the small relationship reader's existing
`required_checks` severity inventory (CRITICAL/HIGH), which remains unchanged.
A response checklist is an obligation for every governing rule, not a severity
filter. Per-result `startup_rule_stats` separately reports the relationship
inventory, including operator pins counted as kernel activation. Look it up by
the result's stable source identity; display names can be ambiguous. Unbound result rows retain their previous fields; no empty
`bound_rules` or check list is added.

The five core candidates below satisfy the universal-guard rationale:
authorization limits any action; comprehension constrains every directive;
research-before-decision prevents unsupported decisions in any role;
skill-discovery establishes the universal routing obligation; artifact-output
policy constrains any artifact before its destination can be chosen. Their
long bodies still require trimming and validation in #2944. Additional
`no-attribution`, `token-security`, and `citation-policy` candidates cover output
authorship, secret disclosure, and fabricated claims across roles. Their
examples remain candidates for extraction in #2945, not blanket exemptions
for all CRITICAL rules. For example, CRITICAL `versioning` is release-scoped.

#### Amendment 2026-10-25 (proposed): root kernel re-evaluated for compound discovery (#3292 item 3)

> **Operator decision 2026-10-25: rejected as proposed.** `no-attribution` and
> `anti-laziness` are two of the behaviours AIWG fights hardest, so both stay
> always loaded: `no-attribution` stays `kernel` and `anti-laziness` stays
> `core`. Delivery at the point of action does not replace them. The other
> dispositions in the table below are proposals only. Each needs a separate
> operator decision per rule before any rule file changes. The re-derived U1
> figures assume every proposed move and are therefore not adopted.

> **U5 live probe result 2026-10-25: no move ships.** The four
> operator-approved candidate moves (`instruction-comprehension` and
> `research-before-decision` to summary, `artifact-output-policy` and
> `citation-policy` to bound) were implemented on a candidate package and
> probed live through compound discovery (Codex gpt-6.1-sol, low effort, n=5,
> 12 scenarios, 60 calls, `test/uat/rule-binding/kernel-moves-probes.yaml`).
> Positive compliance, meaning that the governing rule was retrieved and
> followed before acting: instruction-comprehension 0.1,
> research-before-decision 0.1, artifact-output-policy 0.2, citation-policy
> 0.8 (0.6 on a second paired run). Negatives were 1.0 for all four. No
> candidate passed its U5 gate. The citation-policy U7 comparison against a
> kernel baseline (positive 0.0, because a kernel rule is never fetched)
> also failed. Under the failed-move rule, all four keep their kernel
> placement. The probe definitions remain for a future attempt after
> discovery and delivery improve.


Compound discovery is implemented: every action result carries its governing
rules (`bound_rules[]`), per-result and whole-response `rule_stats`, and
machine-checkable `required_rule_checks[]` with a fetch-and-follow obligation
(`839f3a46f` in [`query-engine.ts`](../../src/artifacts/query-engine.ts),
tests in #3568). The governing rules now arrive at the point of action, so
kernel admission is re-evaluated. The root kernel becomes the small set of
universal safety rules plus the routing rule (`skill-discovery`) that obliges
agents to run discovery and follow the rules it returns. This amendment moves
or removes no rule file; implementing the dispositions below is a later issue.

Revised admission: checks 1, 3, 4, and 5 above are unchanged. For placements
decided after this date, check 2 reads as the **discovery-first test**: a rule
stays kernel only if a compliant agent could violate its invariant before it
can run discovery or load any scoped artifact. When compound discovery or the
selected component's binding reliably delivers the rule first, that route is
the placement. Severity and byte targets still cannot demote a rule, and a
failed move retains the prior placement.

Census method: kernel rules are the rule files under `agentic/code/**/rules/`
whose frontmatter declares the scalar `activation: kernel` (validated by
[`rule-activation.ts`](../../src/lint/rule-activation.ts);
`npm run lint:rule-activation`). Skill `kernel: true` is a separate
artifact-index flag, not rule admission, and `RULES-INDEX.md` files are
summary-and-path indexes the artifact index excludes from the rule census. On
2026-10-25 that census is **19 files holding 18 distinct rules**:
`skill-discovery` ships as two byte-identical bodies (`addons/aiwg-utils` and
`plugins/utils`; counted once below, deduplication without semantic change is
later work), and `citation-policy` uses the equivalent quoted form
`activation: "kernel"`.

Disposition of the 18 distinct kernel rules under the revised criteria:

| Rule | Disposition | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `human-authorization` | Stay kernel | Acting on a finding can precede any discovery call, so no binding delivers it first. |
| `token-security` | Stay kernel | A secret can leak in the first reply before any artifact is selected. |
| `skill-discovery` | Stay kernel, one canonical copy | The routing obligation cannot be delivered by the discovery it mandates. |
| `instruction-comprehension` | Move to `summary` | Universal but not safety; a startup one-liner plus discovery-delivered detail suffices. |
| `research-before-decision` | Move to `summary` | Governed decisions always follow task framing that discovery can see. |
| `artifact-output-policy` | Move to `bound` | Artifact production always follows scoped workflow selection; bind to artifact-producing workflows. |
| `no-attribution` | **Stay kernel (operator decision 2026-10-25)** | Proposed move to `bound` rejected: attribution leaks happen in any output, not only delivery artifacts. |
| `citation-policy` | Move to `bound` | Claims travel with research outputs; deliver with the research artifacts that produce them. |
| `dev-pipeline-safety` | Kernel when extension installed | Suppressing a CI signal happens in the first pipeline command, before discovery. |
| `it-change-control` | Kernel when extension installed | Network/identity changes are destructive before any scoped artifact loads. |
| `net-change-blast-radius` | Kernel when extension installed | Blast-radius assessment must precede the change itself. |
| `sec-key-material-handling` | Kernel when extension installed | Key-material exposure precedes artifact selection. |
| `sec-luks-dual-phase` | Kernel when extension installed | Disk-encryption operations are irreversible without the gate. |
| `stream-safety` | Kernel when extension installed | Stream credential exposure precedes scoped work. |
| `sys-hardware-safety` | Kernel when extension installed | Firmware/partition operations are destructive before discovery runs. |
| `sys-interactive-gate` | Kernel when extension installed | Interactive shell commands occur before artifact loading. |
| `ops-safety` | Kernel when ops framework installed | Destructive-command approval precedes discovery. |
| `ops-information-governance` | Kernel when ops framework installed | Operational payloads reach responses before scoped selection. |

Re-derived Wave 4 U1 target: the base always-loaded profile (aiwg-utils plus
sdlc-complete) currently holds 8 kernel files totalling 26,177 B. Under the
dispositions above the retained root kernel is 3 rules totalling 9,429 B
(`human-authorization` 2,672 + `token-security` 3,475 + `skill-discovery`
3,282, canonical copy); 16,748 B across the 5 moved rules leaves the kernel,
returning only summaries and index pointers as I. The emitted rule-byte
formula is unchanged (K + I + P, plus separately reported B), and the Wave 4
target stays ≤45,000 B, so I + P + delivery overhead must fit the remaining
35,571 B once the complete retained set is measured. Extension kernels
(8 rules, 33,246 B) and ops-framework kernels (2 rules, 10,501 B) are excluded
from the base-profile count and measured inside their own profiles. This
re-derivation raises no target and drops no safety contract to manufacture a
pass.

U5 probe re-runs of every moved rule through compound discovery are pending:
per operator direction 2026-10-20, full verification runs quarterly, so no
disposition above ships before its n=5 positive/negative gate and the release
comparison pass.

### Starting disposition: the epic's 20 rules

This preserves the epic's starting map and resolves its mixed-mode notation.
Targets are migration families subject to the exact-ID resolution above.

| Rule | Activation | Binding/path scope and reason |
|---|---|---|
| human-authorization | kernel | Universal action authority. |
| instruction-comprehension | kernel | Universal directive interpretation. |

### Behaviors inventory and #3222 disposition

The eight `.claude/rules/behaviors/*.md` files are generated by
`collectBehaviorDirs` / `deployEmulatedBehaviors` in the same base deployer.
The first four sources below are under `agentic/code/behaviors/`, two under
`agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/behaviors/`, and two under
`agentic/code/addons/aiwg-fleet/behaviors/`; each uses `<name>/BEHAVIOR.md`.

| Deployed file | Contract and actual runtime consumer | Proposed bound agents / reason |
|---|---|---|
| `concierge.md` | Daemon front desk: routing, tone, session memory; `concierge` agent. The executable daemon loader uses the separate addon `concierge.behavior.md` and `tools/daemon/concierge/orchestrator.mjs`, not this directory bundle. | `concierge`; bound to the daemon interaction role, not all sessions. |
| `test-watcher.md` | Source/test file-write triggers and two-hour test schedule; bundle scripts/native behavior runtime. No dedicated indexed watcher agent is declared today. | `test-engineer`; bound to test execution, with the daemon's model-assisted watcher task routed through this definition. |
| `build-monitor.md` | Build/tsc completion and four-hour build checks; bundle scripts/native behavior runtime, not an always-running coding agent. | `build-engineer`; bound to build monitoring tasks. |
| `security-sentinel.md` | File-change scans, post-deploy checks, six-hour audits; bundle scripts/native behavior runtime. | `security-auditor`; bound to scanning tasks. General secret safety remains kernel. |
| `artifact-sync.md` | SDLC artifact-write triggers; incremental/full index synchronization scripts. | `context-librarian` (also bind `build-artifact-index` skill); artifact indexing is scoped work. |
| `quality-gate-watcher.md` | Commit/PR gate checks and phase evaluation; scripts/native behavior runtime. | `quality-assessor`, `security-gatekeeper`; bind evaluation tasks, not every development turn. |
| `quiet-bot.md` | Fleet message-addressing policy; OpenClaw bot runtime. Fleet documentation names InfsolClaw as an example, not a shipped agent definition. | Proposed `fleet-quiet-bot` adapter agent; mention-only chat policy must not silence unrelated agents. |
| `quiet-business-bot.md` | Fleet addressing plus strict business domain; Quickbooksbot is the documented deployment example, not an indexed agent. | Proposed `fleet-business-bot` adapter agent; domain restriction belongs to that bot role. |

All eight use **`activation: bound`**; none passes kernel admission. These are
proposed bindings, not claims that watcher scripts currently invoke the named
SDLC agents. #3222 must wire model-assisted daemon/bot entry points to load their
selected agent definition and its bound rules before handling a matching event.
Script-only handlers continue to execute through existing hook/runtime owners;
prompt injection must not start a schedule or execute scripts at deployment.

The fleet addon ships behavior bundles but no agents. #3222 must add the two
small indexed adapter definitions named above (or resolve an explicit reviewed
project-owned equivalent), then validate bindings. Do not invent an unresolved
`agents: [Quickbooksbot]` binding or silently skip it. Keep old delivery until
the adapter and U3/U5 fixtures exist. This is ordinary agent authoring and
existing daemon dispatch, not a new behavior scheduler or binding service.

The daemon addon's `behaviors/concierge.behavior.md` is a distinct lifecycle
contract, not a ninth file in this measured Claude directory. Coordinate its
metadata with the `concierge` binding while retaining its module/hook behavior.
OpenClaw's native behavior installation and hooks are preserved; #3222 changes
Claude context placement, with other provider blocks owned by #2939.

## Alternatives and trade-offs

| Alternative | Benefit | Reason not selected |
|---|---|---|
| Continue tier-only loading plus largest-first budget demotion | Small implementation and bounded directory size. | Conflates severity with relevance and silently removes compliance; six rules already demonstrate the failure. |
| Only deploy-time blocks (A) | Native invocation carries policy without another query. | Discovered source artifacts bypass deployed copies. |
| Only show/MCP expansion (B) | One retrieval point and no generated block maintenance. | Native kernel skill/agent invocation can bypass show entirely. |
| Full rule bodies in every bound artifact by default | Self-contained invocation without a follow-up read. | Duplicates large bodies across artifacts and dispatches; explicit show expansion supplies this when needed. |
| Summary-only delivery with no full-rule fetch obligation | Lowest invocation cost. | A 240-character core cannot encode detailed compliance requirements. |
| Native provider modes only | Less emulation and closer harness integration. | Leaves Codex/Hermes/Warp without path parity and treats Cursor auto selection as guaranteed binding. |
| Make all CRITICAL rules kernel | Conservative severity handling. | Release-only and other scoped safety rules still inflate unrelated contexts; admission must be about universal applicability. |
| Drop untagged rules or default all to on-demand | Immediate startup reduction. | Breaks existing compliance during migration; tier fallback with warnings is explicit and reversible. |

Both delivery paths require idempotent generation and parity fixtures.
Summaries add a retrieval step and path emulation depends on agent compliance.
The guard can now block deployment instead of producing a smaller incomplete
one. Those costs are preferable to silently changing which instructions apply.

## Rollout and validation

Keep ownership in base/provider writers (including Warp/Cursor aggregate
scripts), the artifact index/query engine, MCP discovery wrappers, and the
existing lint runner. This ADR does not implement #2938–#2940 or #2839.

#2936 measures rules **and behaviors**, indexes, bootstrap duplication, and
per-provider/subagent context before moves. #2938 adds schema/lint/guard;
#2939 and #2940 supply both delivery paths before migration waves remove
startup bodies. #3222 completes behavior bindings alongside those changes.
Wave 3 binds existing orchestration text without waiting for #2645/#2646.

Retain U1–U9 as release gates: U1 ≤110,000 rule bytes after Wave 1 and ≤45,000
after Wave 4, with behavior bytes separately reported and included in total;
U2 complete activation coverage by migration end; U3 resolving bindings and
injected blocks on six providers; U4 CLI/MCP JSON parity; U5 n=5 compliance at
least baseline and ≥80%; U6 top-three natural-language rule discovery; U7 no
irrelevant fetch in at least 4/5 negatives; U8 full-deploy steward/mission
subagent dispatch headroom; U9 provider fixtures and Codex <32 KB.
Re-derive U1 from retained contracts rather than inventing a smaller root set:
let K be the complete retained kernel bodies in each harness rules surface, I the required rule indexes/routing wrappers, P the native
path-conditioned bodies counted by the measurement fixture, and B its behavior
bytes. The emitted rule-byte total is K + I + P, and total policy footprint
also reports B. The historical five-core Wave 4 fixture measured 9,706 B of
kernel bodies, leaving 35,294 B within the 45,000 B target for the other retained
contracts and delivery overhead. That fixture actually emitted 142,962 B
(including legacy fallback/index/path content), a 97,962 B gap; it did not pass
U1. Those numbers are historical evidence, not a current full-profile claim.
Compound summaries move no rule bytes by themselves. Keep the 45,000 B target
and provider hard caps as explicit unmet checks until the complete retained
set is measured; do not raise the target or drop safety contracts to manufacture
a pass. Future target changes require a reviewed component-level derivation
and U5 evidence, not this offline implementation alone.

The full-profile ~40–55 KB outcome remains a projection pending Wave 5 and
behavior validation, not an achieved result of this documentation change.

Add fixtures for each mode/provider, mixed paths/bindings, negative nonmatches,
invalid modes, missing summaries/targets, idempotent redeploy, unchanged unbound
show output, body-expansion opt-in, legacy fallback warnings, and budget overrun
without any demotion. Include behaviors and old budget-sidecar recovery.
Behavioral model probes belong to the authorized later validation run; this ADR
work uses offline inventory and tests only. A failing move reverts individually
to `activation: kernel`, removing incompatible binding/path fields as necessary;
the guard still reports any resulting overrun. No wave ships without U1–U9.

## Machine-readable starting map

This appendix is a disposition inventory, not authored frontmatter. `rules`
lists every body in the reproduced SDLC/Claude always-loaded directory;
`generated` lists its two indexes; `behaviors` lists all eight wrappers.
`budget_demoted` restores visibility of all six absent bodies. The epic's
`decision-offload` is included separately because its explicit-install addon is
absent from this profile. Group keys resolve beneath `agentic/code/`; rule keys
are `.md` stems. Behavior keys resolve to `<source_root>/<name>/BEHAVIOR.md` and
deploy as `.claude/rules/behaviors/<name>.md`. Bindings for the epic's 20 are
defined above; remaining corpus assignments are starting decisions for #2945,
subject to exact targets and probes before removal from startup.

### Legacy provider migration (#3457)

Copilot, Factory, OpenCode, Windsurf, Antigravity, Muse, OMP and Grok Build
use the shared transactional activation projector for direct deployments as
well as kernel-only `use all`. Compact core bodies are first in the managed
startup rule block; a harness-specific hook reaches kernel bodies and the activation index in rule files. Core bodies
retain the shared 1,024-byte per-body and 6,144-byte aggregate caps, with no
imports of full rule files.

| Provider | Always-loaded project surface | Loader evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Copilot custom instructions contract |
| Factory | `AGENTS.md` | Factory AGENTS discovery hierarchy |
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md`, `AIWG.md`, `.opencode/rule/*.md` | [OpenCode rules and instructions registration](https://opencode.ai/docs/rules/) (`CONTEXT_CONTRACTS`) |
| Windsurf | `AGENTS.md` | Windsurf/Devin topology contract |
| Antigravity | `AGENTS.md` | [Qualified CLI 1.1.26 project context](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/overview/) (`CONTEXT_CONTRACTS`, verified 2026-09-04) |
| Muse | `AGENTS.md` | Muse context contract; workspace trust required |
| OMP | `.omp/AGENTS.md` | [OMP 18.1.10 context loader at 5964a0f7649275bcde818f20073193fd032451f2](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/blob/5964a0f7649275bcde818f20073193fd032451f2/packages/coding-agent/src/system-prompt.ts#L451); shadows root context |
| Grok Build (`grok-build`) | `AGENTS.md`, `.grok/rules/*.md` | [xAI project-rules hierarchical discovery](https://docs.x.ai/build/features/project-rules); [released CLI 1.0.38, reviewed public tree 2bdd1d6a6369de0e8c68132ea4539e9abd9e14a8](../providers/grok-build-qualification.md) (source pin, not binary build provenance) |

The authoritative loader evidence and source links are in
`src/providers/provider-definitions.ts` (`CONTEXT_CONTRACTS`), with qualified
provider documentation under `docs/providers/`. Native rule helpers remain
available for compatibility; staged deployment lets activation projection own
rule output and startup policy.

There is no bare `grok` provider alias. Grok Bot (`grokbot`) is a separate,
degraded target whose automatic startup loader is unverified. It cannot claim
always-loaded core delivery; do not treat writing a conventional AGENTS file
as proof of a Grok Bot loader.
